# Tic Tac Toe - Game using React

Play the game [here](https://sameer-j.github.io/react-tic-tac-toe)

A learning project based on the [official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

a tic-tac-toe game that:

- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

## TO DO:  
- [x] Basic App
- [ ] Time Travel - Going to a older moveset
- [ ] Improvements
  - [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
  - [ ] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
  - [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
  - [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
  - [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
  - [ ] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
- [ ] Themefy using Context API
- [ ] Convert to functional componets and state mgmt using hooks, branch out for class components
- [x] Deploy to gh pages

Other ideas (may be crazy):
- [ ] cross platform: mobile, pwa, desktop app
- [ ] Sync across devices
- [ ] User management including login, history of wins, sequence of moves in older games
- [ ] Turn based game. Notifies opponent of his turn
